"""Per-pot rim scale (P1 T6, 2026-10-12): pot records, rim-plane homography, uncertainty, ruler cross-check.

Measured reference (user, 2026-10-12, caliper, ``source_kind = measured``): the pots are **square cells,
60 mm outer top edge across the flats**, 70 mm deep. The value enters through the human record
``data/records/pots/pot_spec.csv`` (human-owned, read-only for agents; template ``build/pot_records_template/``),
never through code or config.

Rules implemented (each has a test):

* **Field.** ``pot_rim_outer_edge_mm`` (square cell, one side, top rim, across the flats) and ``pot_depth_mm``
  (recorded only, never a scale source) beside the older round-pot ``pot_rim_inner_diameter_mm``. A record carries
  one rim convention or the other, never both; every mm value names its ``scale_convention``.
* **Per pot, never image-wide.** Handheld top views are perspective projections, so the scale is derived per pot
  from that pot's own rim in that image: points clicked on the four flat rim edges
  (``data/records/pots/rim_points.csv``, keyed by plant and the photo's sha256) -> one line per side ->
  their four intersections = the corners of the across-flats square (the chamfers are cut off, the lines are not)
  -> the homography from the image to the reference plane (``plant_local_mm``, origin at the pot centre, axes along
  the rim sides; the rotation about Z stays unknown - no orientation mark exists). ``mm_per_px`` is the local scale
  at the pot centre (``sqrt|det J|``); the full homography is kept in ``frame_transforms.csv``.
* **Plane.** Leaves sit above the reference plane, nearer the camera, so they are magnified in the photo and a
  rim-derived scale OVERESTIMATES their sizes (factor Z_ref / Z_leaf > 1; corrected 2026-10-12 - the T6 prompt said
  "underestimates", which is the wrong direction). That is the existing ``plant_local_mm`` convention (definitions
  section 2: a plane projection, never called "true size"); no correction factor is applied.
* **Uncertainty.** Every rim point carries the annotator's stated click uncertainty in px; per side the larger of
  that and the line-fit residual RMS is used, and propagated to ``mm_per_px`` (and to every mm value) by a seeded
  Monte Carlo. No stated uncertainty -> no mm value.
* **Cross-check.** Where the photo has a second source - ticks of the ruler lying on the rim, clicked with their
  readings - the ruler distance measured through the rim homography is compared with its reading (STAGE1 rule as
  given in T6): within 2 % -> accepted; more than 5 % -> stop (scale unavailable, reported); in between ->
  flagged and reported. Only the pot rim -> ``scale_sources = 1``, no cross-check. Sources are never averaged.

Revision 2026-10-13 (inner rim line and its plane; prompt ``CLAUDE_CODE_CLI_PROMPT_P1_RIM_INNER_PLANE_2026-10-13``):

* **New measurements** (user, caliper, ``measured``): inner top edge 59 mm across the flats, medium surface 10 mm
  below the rim, straight walls (no taper). Pot-spec columns ``pot_rim_inner_edge_mm``,
  ``medium_surface_depth_below_rim_mm``, ``wall_taper``, each with its own ``*_source_kind``. Old 10-column records
  still parse (the new values are then unavailable).
* **Which line, which plane.** Every rim point names its line in the new ``edge`` column: ``outer_top`` (outer top
  edge, rim plane, outer value), ``inner_top`` (inner top edge, rim plane, inner value) or ``medium_junction``
  (where the medium meets the inner wall: inner value - straight walls only - on the plane ``depth`` below the rim).
  Records without the column were collected under the "outer flat edges" instruction and are read as ``outer_top``.
  A rim side whose inner wall faces away from the camera (the FRONT side of a side photo) shows NO medium junction:
  the sharp rim/soil line there is the ``inner_top`` edge hiding the medium, i.e. still on the rim plane.
* **The plane travels with the value.** A solved scale names ``reference`` (the lines), ``reference_plane``
  (``pot_rim`` | ``medium_surface``) and its offset from the rim (0 or ``-depth``). One homography needs all four
  lines on one plane; outer and inner top edges may be mixed on the rim plane (per-side half widths).
* **Occluded side.** ``side_occluded`` rows (side number only) state that a side is hidden (e.g. the back rim behind
  leaves); it is reported as occluded, not as a detection failure. Three lines alone do not fix a homography.
