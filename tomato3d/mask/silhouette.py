"""Plant silhouette masking.

The board is rejected **geometrically**, never by colour: the substrate is vermiculite,
which is as bright and as uniform as parts of the board, so any colour rule that removes
the board also removes the pot. Instead the board rectangle is projected from the solved
pose and everything on the board plane within its measured extent is discarded.

What survives that rejection is the image of the vertical prism standing on the board
footprint - "everything above the board plane inside the board footprint". Only inside
that region is a pixel classified as plant or not, and that classification is the one
step that does read colour.

Consequence worth knowing: anything that projects *onto* the board quad, rather than
above it, is discarded with the board. From a side view that is the pot and lower stem;
from a top view it is the **whole plant**, which is why :data:`SUPPORTED_VIEW_TYPES`
excludes top views. That is what rejecting the board by its 2D projection costs, and it
is why this boundary is kept stable - a segmenter that keeps foreground above the board
can replace :func:`segment_plant_silhouette` without touching any caller.
